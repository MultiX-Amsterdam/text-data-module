The dataset was created by selecting the 4 largest classes from the original corpus, resulting in 120,000 training samples and 7,600 testing samples. The dataset is provided by the academic community for research purposes in data mining, information retrieval, and other non-commercial activities. We will use it to demonstrate various NLP techniques on real data, and in the end make 2 models with this data. The files train.csv and test.csv contain all the training and testing samples as comma-separated values with 3 columns: class index, title, and description.

    "Tokenization is the process of breaking down a text into individual tokens, which are usually words but can also be phrases or sentences. It helps language models to understand and analyze text data by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces. While it may seem like a trivial task, tokenization can be applied in multiple ways and thus be a complex and challenging task influencing NLP applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in languages like English, it is generally straightforward to identify words by using spaces as delimiters. However, there are exceptions, such as contractions like \"can't\" and hyphenated words like \"self-driving\". And in Dutch, where multiple nouns can be combined into one bigger noun without any delimiter this can be hard. How would you tokenize \"hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliofobie\"? In other languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, there are no spaces between words, so identifying word boundaries is much more difficult. \n",

    "Stemming is a technique that involves reducing words to their base or stem form by removing any affixes or suffixes. For example, the stem of the word \"lazily\" would be \"lazi\". Stemming is a simple and fast technique that can be useful. However, it can also produce inaccurate or incorrect results since it does not consider the context or part of speech of the word.\n",

Unlike stemming, lemmatization can consider the context and part of speech of the word, which can make it more accurate and reliable. With lemmatization, the lemma of the word \"lazily\" would be \"lazy\". Lemmatization can be slower and more complex than stemming but provides a higher level of normalization."
